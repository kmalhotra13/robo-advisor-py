# "Robo Advisor" Project

Issues requests to the [AlphaVantage Stock Market API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) in order to provide automated stock or cryptocurrency trading recommendations.

## Prerequisites

  + Anaconda 3.7
  + Python 3.7
  + Pip

## Setup

Before using or developing this application, take a moment to [obtain an AlphaVantage API Key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) (e.g. "abc123").

After obtaining an API Key, copy the ".env.example" file to a new file called ".env", and update the contents of the ".env" file to specify your real API Key.

Don't worry, the ".env" has already been [ignored](/.gitignore) from version control for you!

## Usage

Run the recommendation script:

```py
python app/robo_advisor.py
```
